## Node.js

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an Environment to run Javascript outside of a browser (as Javascript is traditionally run in a browswer). It was created in 2009 and was build on top of Chrome's [V8 Javascript engine](https://v8.dev).

With the help of Node.js, it has never been easier to build full stack applications since both the front end and the back end are essentially built in the same language.

With this in mind, lets get into learning Node.js!

### The difference between Browser JavaScript and Node.js

When working with Node you have **no access to browser APIs**. So that means:

- no DOM

- No Geolocation

- No Fetch

- or any cool browser goodies.

With Node we are interested in **server side apps**.

### 1. intro.js

Pretty basic stuff. Nothing exciting but I am following along. Check out the file [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express/Node/1-intro.js).

### 2-4. Modules

Showing how to use modules for making cleaner code. Pretty cool. Check out the file [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Node%20%and%20%eExpress/Node/2-modules.js). See relevant modules [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Node%20%and%20%eExpress/Node/3-names.js) and [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Node%20%and%20%eExpress/Node/4-utils.js).

### 5. Built in Modules

#### 5.1 OS

The `os` module is really useful for getting information on our computer which we are using and the operating system. Check out the file [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express/Node/5.1-os.js) for some basic functions.

#### 5.2 PATH

The `path` module is useful for modifying and manipulating path variables. Check out the file [here]((https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express/Node/5.2-path.js) for some basic functions.

#### 5.3 FS

#### 5.4 HTTP

There are more but for this tutorial only these will be covered.
