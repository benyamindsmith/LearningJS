## Node.js

### What is Node.js?

Node.js is an Environment to run Javascript outside of a browser (as Javascript is traditionally run in a browswer). It was created in 2009 and was build on top of Chrome's [V8 Javascript engine](https://v8.dev).

With the help of Node.js, it has never been easier to build full stack applications since both the front end and the back end are essentially built in the same language.

With this in mind, lets get into learning Node.js!

### The difference between Browser JavaScript and Node.js

When working with Node you have **no access to browser APIs**. So that means:

- no DOM

- No Geolocation

- No Fetch

- or any cool browser goodies.

With Node we are interested in **server side apps**.

### 1. intro.js

Pretty basic stuff. Nothing exciting but I am following along. Check out the file [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express/Node/1-intro.js).

### 2-4. Modules

Showing how to use modules for making cleaner code. Pretty cool. Check out the file [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Node%20%and%20%eExpress/Node/2-modules.js). See relevant modules [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Node%20%and%20%eExpress/Node/3-names.js) and [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Node%20%and%20%eExpress/Node/4-utils.js).

### 5. Built in Modules

There are more than these listed, but for this tutorial only these were be covered.

#### 5.1 OS

The `os` module is really useful for getting information on our computer which we are using and the operating system. Check out the file [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express/Node/5.1-os.js) for some basic functions.

#### 5.2 PATH

The `path` module is useful for modifying and manipulating path variables. Check out the file [here]((https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express/Node/5.2-path.js) for some basic functions.

#### 5.3 FS

The `fs` module is useful for reading and modifying files. Check out the file [here]() for some basic usage.

#### 5.4 Asyncronous FS

The code used in 5.3 is syncronous. This means that the code is procedural and can result in slow response times. Asycronous code works around this. Check out the file [here]() for usage.

#### 5.5 HTTP

The `http` is a module is crutal when looking to spin up a server and work with networking. See my code for spinning up some basic webpages [here]()

### NPM

When we install Node, NPM comes installed with it. NPM allows us to intall packages that we need for our development.

## Express.js

### 1.

### 2.

## Websockets

Some work on my understanding of how websockets work. Based on information from this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FduLSXEHLng&ab_channel=dcode).
