# React
-->

The following are codes that I wrote while learning React with [FreeCodeCamp's Full React Course 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4). This is one of the more popular Javascript Frameworks, so I thought I would give it a shot.

## Command Line Basics

Some basic commands to use in command line:

1. `pwd` - full path name to current working directory

2. `ls` - list of directories

3. `mkdir` - create directory/folder

4. `cd` - change directory

5. `cd ..` - navigate to parent/one level up

6. `clear` - clear console

## NPM Basics

[folder]()

### 1 . `npm init`

Creates `package.json` (manifest) file, list dependencies (see [here]() to see example of the `package.json` file we created)

### 2. `npm install <package name> --save`

Install package locally (default) and add to package.json (see here to see the [`node_modules`]() folder created).

When we start to use `Create-React-App` this file will be much bigger. If you are sharing this on github, usually you will just add `package.json` only

### 3. `npm install <package name> -g`

Install package globally (access anywhere) [`sudo`]

### 4. `npm install <package name> --save-dev`

Use only in development;
