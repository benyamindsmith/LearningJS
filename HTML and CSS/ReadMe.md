# HTML and CSS

In my attempts to try to learn React- I saw that there was an barrier for fully understanding without a clear idea of HTML and CSS. While I knew enough (at the time) to wing it, I feel like spending the time to actually learn HTML and CSS properly would be a good investment of time before I get into React.

The codes here are from [Bro Code's HTML and CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyuzt1Dp8X8)
