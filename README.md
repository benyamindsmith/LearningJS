# LearningJS

A Repository of my Adventures with Javascript.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Tutorials

A folder of codes I developed while learning Javascript with [FreeCodeCamp's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=1687s) on the topic. This is what really got me started so theres alot of very elementary things happening here. Thank you Beau for getting me started!

### 2. OOP

Before getting started with learning about frameworks I thought now is the best time more than ever to properly learn object oriented programming to save myself the confusion along the way. The codes are based on [Traversy Media's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDJpGenyHaA) on the topic.
