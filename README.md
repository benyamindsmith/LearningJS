# LearningJS

A Repository of my Adventures with Javascript.

## Table of Contents

### 1. Tutorials

A folder of codes I developed while learning Javascript with [FreeCodeCamp's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=1687s) on the topic. This is what really got me started so theres alot of very elementary things happening here. Thank you Beau for getting me started!

See the folder [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Tutorials)

### 2. OOP

Before getting started with learning about frameworks I thought now is the best time more than ever to properly learn object oriented programming to save myself the confusion along the way. The codes are based on [Traversy Media's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDJpGenyHaA) on the topic.

### 3. HTML and CSS

After a couple of attempts with trying to learn React and other frameworks, I realized I was winging my understanding of HTML and CSS. This folder is a detour on my path to get the fundamentals of HTML and CSS down. The codes here are from [Bro Code's HTML and CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyuzt1Dp8X8).
