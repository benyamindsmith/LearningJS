### 1. Tutorials

A folder of codes I developed while learning Javascript with [FreeCodeCamp's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=1687s) on the topic. This is what really got me started so theres alot of very elementary things happening here. Thank you Beau for getting me started!

See the folder [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Tutorials)

### 2. OOP

Before getting started with learning about frameworks I thought now is the best time more than ever to properly learn object oriented programming to save myself the confusion along the way. The codes are based on [Traversy Media's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDJpGenyHaA) on the topic.

See the folder [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/OOP)

### 3. Async/Await

I was really excited to get into learning frameworks but as I started learning Node.js I realized I had a gap in my understandng asynchronous javascript. Instead of going ahead and "winging it" I thought it would be better to use my time properly learning how this works and having my own snippets to remind myself how this works. The codes are based on what I learned using the [The Net Ninja's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcQyJ-gxke0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jx2TTZk3IGWKSbtugYdrlu) video series on the topic.

See the folder [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/AsyncAwait)

### 4. HTML and CSS

After a couple of attempts with trying to learn React and other frameworks, I realized I was winging my understanding of HTML and CSS. This folder is a detour on my path to get the fundamentals of HTML and CSS down. The codes here are from [Bro Code's HTML and CSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyuzt1Dp8X8).

See the folder [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/HTML%20and%20CSS)

### 5. React.js

The following are codes that I wrote while learning React with [FreeCodeCamp's Full React Course 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4). This is one of the more popular Javascript Frameworks. So I thought I would give it a shot.

See the folder [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/React)

### 6. Node.js and Express.js

Its one thing to learn how to have code run in a browser. Its another thing to have a back end built up as well. My experience with learning Javascript would not be complete if I didn't learn these back end frameworks. The codes are from what I learned in [FreeCodeCamp's Node.js and Express.js full course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE)

See the folder [here](https://github.com/benyamindsmith/LearningJS/tree/main/Node%20and%20Express)
